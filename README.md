### Notes on using installer - installing Erlang
1. First you need to install a [supported version of Erlang](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) for
Windows.
2. The most recent stable Erlang/OTP release series supported by
RabbitMQ 3.9.x is 24.x.
3. Important : RabbitMQ requires a 64-bit version of Erlang
4. For RabbitMQ 3.9.11 download and run the [Erlang 24.1.7
Windows Installer](https://www.erlang.org/patches/otp-24.1.7).
5. Important : You must run the Erlang installer using an
administrative account otherwise a registry key expected by the
RabbitMQ installer will not be present
### Notes on using installer - installing RabbitMQ

### Install the RabbitMQ Management Plugin

2. change directory to the sbin folder within the RabbitMQ Server
installation directory (e.g. %PROGRAMFILES%\RabbitMQ

3. next, run the following command to enable the [rabbitmq management
plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html):

RabbitMQ service. Execute the following sequence of commands to
reinstall the service:
